#### BioModels focus

- $52\%$ considering there's a significant crisis

- $90\%$ considering there's a Reproducibility crisis generally speaking

- From @opensciencecollaboration2015s analyses, $40\%$ of studies in psychology are trustworthy...

- ... and only $10\%$ in cancer biology, from @begley2012n

Most features on reproducibility crisis date back from 10 years ago -> what are the features from now on?

### {#repro-categories data-menu-title="Reproducibility Definition"}

[Different types of reproducibility]{.slide-title}

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Empirical reproducibility 

Aka **Methodological Reproducibility**: 

- Ability to repeat the same experiment using the same methodology and obtain the same results
- **Example in scRNA-seq**: 2 teams working on the same tissue, get similar distribution of cell type abundances

#### Statistical reproducibility 

- Reproduce statistical results derived from data analysis ($p$-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, ...) using the same statistical methods (or slightly similar ones)

- Also named Inferential Reproducibility

- Examples in **sensitivity analyses**: does a change of the random seed or the sampling process induce significant changes of biological findings?^[**P-hacking** refers to the process of tweaking datasets or models until finding something statistically significant, or recovering their prior biological hypotheses.]

#### Computational reproducibility

- Also named Result Reproducibility, can encompass all previously mentioned reproducibility approaches.

- Ability to reproduce the computational aspects of a study, which includes reproducing the figures, tables, or other outputs from the data and code provided.

- Example in mathematical models: given the same fixed parameters, can you recover the same steady-state conditions?

- **Core objective**: 12 group students aim at reproducing the main findings from a previously published study, namely the subset of DEGs.

- Two-stage Hackathon: 

  1. Free choice of differential analysis model, genome reference and filtering thresholds (scenario A)
  2. Constrained choice of methods and hyperparameters (scenario B)
  
- **Conclusion**: majority of the differentially expressed genes were common to only a few groups (and no DEG found across all the 12 groups), while all pipelines were runnable.

Recently paper in @initiative2025 managed to only reproduce around $1/4$ of recently published replicates of 3 common experimental techniques for quantifying gene expression. Besides, @initiative2025 demonstrate systematic underestimation of true coefficient of variation (and higher effect size) in original experiments.

![BioModels x BioQuant x BioMedX Team VPE sponsors.](images/reprohackathon_sponsors.png){width=95% style="border-radius:1em;margin-top:auto"}


- *Objective*: curate 11 mathematical models of human disease. Cross-disciplinary teams: one biologist, one data scientist, and one computational modeller.
- *Methods*: reproduce **at least one output** (or recode when only hard-coded ODE equations were provided) of a given biological model + curate **species** to standard ontologies.
- *Results*: 2 models were completely curated, 4 models were almost recoded and reproduced, 5 models were partially reproduced.
