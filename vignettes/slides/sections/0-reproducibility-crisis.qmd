-   From @opensciencecollaboration2015s analyses, $40\%$ of studies in psychology are trustworthy...

-   ... and only $10\%$ in cancer biology, from @begley2012n.

Most features on reproducibility crisis date back from 10 years ago :arrow_forward: what are the features from now on?

###  {#repro-categories data-menu-title="Reproducibility Definition"}

[Different types of reproducibility]{.slide-title}

::: panel-tabset
#### Empirical reproducibility

Aka **Methodological Reproducibility**:

-   Ability to repeat the same experiment using the same methodology and obtain the same results
-   *Example in scRNA-seq*: 2 teams working on the same tissue, get similar distribution of cell type abundances
-   *Example in biomedical studies*: The @initiative2025 Brasilian consortium only recovered findings of $1/4$ of 3 commonly used techniques for quantifying gene expression, while demonstrating *systematic underestimation* of true coefficient of variation in original experiments.

#### Statistical reproducibility

-   Also named **Inferential Reproducibility**

-   Reproduce statistical results derived from data analysis using the same statistical methods (or slightly similar ones)

-   Examples in **sensitivity analyses**: does a change of the random seed or the sampling process induce significant changes of biological findings?[^0-reproducibility-crisis-1]

![Satirical illustration of **Data dredging**, aka **data snooping** or $p$-hacking, from [`sbmc-comics`](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/p-2).](images/p-hacking.png)

#### Computational reproducibility

-   Also named **Result Reproducibility**, the most generalist.

-   Ability to reproduce the computational aspects of a study, including reproducing Figures, Tables, or other outputs from the data and code provided.

-   *Example in ODE models*: given the same fixed parameters, can you recover the steady-state conditions?

[^0-reproducibility-crisis-1]: **P-hacking** refers to the process of tweaking datasets or models until finding something statistically significant, or recovering their prior biological hypotheses.

-   **Core objective**: 12 group students aim at recovering DEGs from a peer-reviewed publication.

-   Two-stage Hackathon:

    1.  Free choice of differential analysis model, genome reference and filtering thresholds (scenario A)
    2.  Constrained choice of methods and hyperparameters (scenario B)

-   **Conclusion**: DEGs poorly overlap between the groups, whereas all pipelines were runnable.
