  abstract = {Precision medicine (PM) is an emerging approach that appears with the impression of changing the existing paradigm of medical practice. Recent advances in technological innovations and genetics and the growing availability of health data have set a new pace of the research and impose a set of new requirements on the different stakeholders. Some studies are available that discuss about the different aspects of PM. Nevertheless, a holistic representation of those aspects deemed to confer with the technological perspective, in relation to the applications and challenges, have been mostly ignored. In this context, this paper surveys the advances in PM from the informatics viewpoint and reviews the enabling tools and techniques in a categorized manner. In addition, the study discusses how other technological paradigms, which include big data, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things, can be exploited to advance the potentials of PM. Furthermore, the paper provides some guidelines for future research for a seamless implementation and a wide-scale deployment of PM based on the identified open issues and the associated challenges. As a result, the paper proposes an integrated holistic framework for PM motivating informatics researchers to design their relevant research work in an appropriate context.},

  abstract = {The reproducibility crisis has highlighted the importance of improving the way bioinformatics data analyses are implemented, executed, and shared. To address this, various tools such as content versioning systems, workflow management systems, and software environment management systems have been developed. While these tools are becoming more widely used, there is still much work to be done to increase their adoption. The most effective way to ensure reproducibility becomes a standard part of most bioinformatics data analysis projects is to integrate it into the curriculum of bioinformatics Master's programs.In this article, we present the Reprohackathon, a Master's course that we have been running for the last 3 years at Universit{\'e} Paris-Saclay (France), and that has been attended by a total of 123 students. The course is divided into two parts. The first part includes lessons on the challenges related to reproducibility, content versioning systems, container management, and workflow systems. In the second part, students work on a data analysis project for 3--4\,months, reanalyzing data from a previously published study. The Reprohackaton has taught us many valuable lessons, such as the fact that implementing reproducible analyses is a complex and challenging task that requires significant effort. However, providing in-depth teaching of the concepts and the tools during a Master's degree program greatly improves students' understanding and abilities in this area.},

In response to this challenge, we introduce a framework that clarifies the roles and definitions of key validation efforts: repeatability, dependent and independent reproducibility, and direct and conceptual replicability. This structured framework aims to provide AI/ML researchers with the necessary clarity on these essential concepts, facilitating the appropriate design, conduct, and interpretation of validation studies. By articulating the nuances and specific roles of each type of validation study, we aim to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of research findings and support the community's efforts to address reproducibility challenges effectively.},

Current tools often manage model visualization data in custom-designed, tool-specific formats and store it separately from the model itself, hindering interoperability, reproducibility, and the seamless integration of visualization with model data. SBMLNetwork addresses these limitations by building directly on the SBML Layout and Render specifications, automating the generation of standards-compliant visualization data, offering a modular implementation with broad integration support, and providing a robust API tailored to the needs of systems biology researchers. We illustrate the capabilities of SBMLNetwork across key visualization tasks, including SBGN-compliant visualization, application of predefined style templates, layout arrangement to reflect pathway logic, and integration of model data into network diagrams. These examples demonstrate how SBMLNetwork enables high-level visualization features and seamlessly translate user intent into reproducible outputs that support both structural representation and dynamic data visualization within the SBML model.

Biomedical research in Brazil expanded rapidly over the last three decades, with no systematic assessment of the replicability of its findings. With this in mind, we set up the Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative, a multicenter replication of published experiments from Brazilian science using three common experimental methods: the MTT assay, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the elevated plus maze (EPM). A total of 56 laboratories performed 143 replications of 56 experiments; of these, 97 replications of 47 experiments were considered valid by an independent committee. Replication rates for these experiments varied between 15 and 45\% according to five predefined criteria. In median terms, relative effects (expressed as ratios between group means) were 60\% larger in original experiments than in replications, while coefficients of variation were 60\% smaller. Effect size decrease was smaller for MTT, cell line experiments and original results with less variability, while t values for replications were positively correlated with researcher predictions about replicability. Deviations from preregistered protocols were very common in replications, most frequently due to reasons inherent to the experimental model or related to infrastructure and logistics. Our results highlight factors that limit the replicability of results published by researchers in Brazil and suggest ways by which this scenario can be improved.},

To provide a platform to support universal sharing, easy accessibility and model reproducibility, BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), a repository for mathematical models, was established in 2005. The current BioModels platform allows submission of models encoded in diverse modelling formats, including SBML, CellML, PharmML, COMBINE archive, MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Python or C++. The models submitted to BioModels are curated to verify the computational representation of the biological process and the reproducibility of the simulation results in the reference publication. The curation also involves encoding models in standard formats and annotation with controlled vocabularies following MIRIAM (minimal information required in the annotation of biochemical models)~guidelines. BioModels now accepts large-scale submission of auto-generated computational models. With gradual growth in content over 15 years, BioModels currently hosts about 2000 models from the published literature. With about 800 curated models, BioModels has become the world's largest repository of curated models and emerged as the third most used data resource after PubMed and Google Scholar among the scientists who use modelling in their research. Thus, BioModels benefits modellers by providing access to reliable and semantically enriched curated models in standard formats that are easy to share, reproduce and reuse.},

  abstract = {Benchmarking, which involves collecting reference datasets and demonstrating method performances, is a requirement for the development of new computational tools, but also becomes a domain of its own to achieve neutral comparisons of methods. Although a lot has been written about how to design and conduct benchmark studies, this Perspective sheds light on a wish list for a computational platform to orchestrate benchmark studies. We discuss various ideas for organizing reproducible software environments, formally defining benchmarks, orchestrating standardized workflows, and how they interface with computing infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

  abstract = {The concept design stage is widely regarded to be the most influential. Key decisions are made and significant project finance is acquired. Traditionally, designs are developed through engineering judgement, driven by experience. However, this approach can be time consuming as designs typically evolve through iteration and it does not guarantee that the most optimal option(s) will be developed.  This thesis discusses the development of a decision support system for the concept design of an LNG terminal - RaPoLa (Rapid Port Layout). It uses a range of computing and mathematical devices to enable options to be developed manually or automatically using both deterministic and probabilistic methodologies. This enables the exploration for optimal concept designs to be accomplished in a multitude of ways.  A full description of the mathematical basis of RaPoLa is given and three chapters detailing practical applications introduce the reader to the core concepts of RaPoLa and demonstrate a clear progression from a simple deterministic, manual design to a fully automated, probabilistic design. The results of using RaPoLa on a case study indicate that it is capable of producing options that more optimal than the traditional approach.},

As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative's FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. These are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guidelines for adoption and fodder for discussion. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.},
