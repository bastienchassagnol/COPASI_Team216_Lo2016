  abstract = {In the rapidly evolving fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the reproducibility crisis underscores the urgent need for clear validation methodologies to maintain scientific integrity and encourage advancement. The crisis is compounded by the prevalent confusion over validation terminology. In response to this challenge, we introduce a framework that clarifies the roles and definitions of key validation efforts: repeatability, dependent and independent reproducibility, and direct and conceptual replicability. This structured framework aims to provide AI/ML researchers with the necessary clarity on these essential concepts, facilitating the appropriate design, conduct, and interpretation of validation studies. By articulating the nuances and specific roles of each type of validation study, we aim to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of research findings and support the community's efforts to address reproducibility challenges effectively.},

Current models view both phenotypes as a continuum of various permutations between Th1, Th2 and Th17 pathways compounded by a range of Treg disfunctions. In the present paper, we develop a mathematical model, by a system of differential equations, which describe the dynamic relations among these T cells and their cytokines. The model identities four groups of CD patients according to up/down regulation of Th1 and Th2. The model simulations show that immunosuppression by TNF-α blockage benefits the group with Th1High/Th2Low while, by contrast, the group with Th1Low/Th2High will benefit from immune activation.},

  abstract = {The concept design stage is widely regarded to be the most influential. Key decisions are made and significant project finance is acquired. Traditionally, designs are developed through engineering judgement, driven by experience. However, this approach can be time consuming as designs typically evolve through iteration and it does not guarantee that the most optimal option(s) will be developed.  This thesis discusses the development of a decision support system for the concept design of an LNG terminal - RaPoLa (Rapid Port Layout). It uses a range of computing and mathematical devices to enable options to be developed manually or automatically using both deterministic and probabilistic methodologies. This enables the exploration for optimal concept designs to be accomplished in a multitude of ways.  A full description of the mathematical basis of RaPoLa is given and three chapters detailing practical applications introduce the reader to the core concepts of RaPoLa and demonstrate a clear progression from a simple deterministic, manual design to a fully automated, probabilistic design. The results of using RaPoLa on a case study indicate that it is capable of producing options that more optimal than the traditional approach.},

  abstract = {Recent trends within computational and data sciences show an increasing recognition and adoption of computational workflows as tools for productivity and reproducibility that also democratize access to platforms and processing know-how. As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative’s FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. These are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guidelines for adoption and fodder for discussion. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.},
