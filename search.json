Only 1/3 of the researchers could be contacted. Number of models is increasing, but the ratio of non-reproducible papers remains the same.\nreasons for non-reproducibility: missing parameters, initial conditions, structural inconsistency and even, in some cases, the reasons remain unclear.\nHow to overcome this challenge? Comply with the reproducibility scorecard (models with score above 4 over 8 are usually reproducible)"
