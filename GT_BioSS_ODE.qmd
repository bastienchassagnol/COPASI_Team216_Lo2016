# Logical Modelling of biological network

## Logical modelling focus:

1. Regulatory graph + Boolean variables + Boolean functions for updating the graph states

Objective: understand the dynamics of the system:

  - Equilibrium points
  - Trajectories

**synchronous updating**: deterministic trajectories (far from biologic perspectives) -> instead, use *asynchronous updating* scheme, in which he activity level of only one component is updated at a time 

- *(STG), state transition graph*: find its properties, such as **stability** (fixed points) and **cyclic attractors**

- **multi-valued** variable, to encompass more qualitative situations or regulatory situations -> enrich the dynamics while enforcing the Boolean dynamics:

    - questions: how to discretise originally quantitative information? 

- **Most permissive updating rule**, from Loic Paulev√©: 

## Boolean properties

- How to refine the graphs: change updating property rules, add nodes, or most permissive updating rule?

- **Reachability**
- `MRBM` method: Identify a **minimal set of components** 

[Refining Boolean models with the partial most permissive scheme](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021794/)

# `AstroLogics`

- Objective: differential Boolean dynamics network

- Logic differences: disjunctive boolean distances

- **Applications**: `Bonesis` tutorial, Invasion model

- Question: which projecting technique used?

# A view of the diversity of Boolean networks, through the lens of canalisation

## Declarative framework and semiology

- solving process: `clingo`, model is named `BoNesis`
- characterise the solution space

(heuristics used: do you have theoretical results confirming the computational speed gain for exploring the graphs' solution space)

## On Model Reduction of Boolean Networks, Patricia Roxo

- How to overcome state explosion? 

  1. Reduction of the graph, while keeping dynamic properties
  
- Time scale separation reduction to be preserved

? **trace** = trajectory

## Reachability Analysis for Parametric Rule-Based Models

- `Kappa`: rule-based language for modelling systems of interacting proteins
- Detects local properties of incomplete models

Objective: find reachable molecular species

Resulting **Horn clause**
